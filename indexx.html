<h2> Health Benefits of Cycling.</h2>
<p>You probably already know that cycling is good for you—any exercise is better than no exercise, right? But did you know that riding a bike offers a whole host of additional health benefits besides the physical perks? Aside from using your rides to get in the recommended 150 minutes of weekly exercise, there are tons of other health benefits you get by spending more time in the saddle. Here’s what happens to your body when you cycle. These 11 health benefits of cycling will make you happier, healthier, and more stoked to keep riding.</p>

<div class="col-md-4"> <strong> 1. More Brainpower </strong>
<p>A study conducted by Charles Hillman showed that exercise boosts brainpower and helps to stave off Alzheimer’s in the elderly. Another study published in Pediatrics showed that kids are even more positively impacted by time on the bike—and that exercise can help control issues like attention deficit disorder.</p>

<div class="col-md-4"> <strong> 2. Faster Recovery </strong>
<p>A recent study found that elderly patients with knee pain and osteoarthritis actually improved their condition when cycling was introduced to their routines, proving that as we get older, taking time to exercise—even just spinning a few minutes a day—can be hugely beneficial.</p> </div>
<div class="col-md-4"> <strong> 3. Improved Heart Health </strong> 
<p>Cycling is also great for your heart—although not just because you love riding so much (though that’s a great reason, too!). A recent study in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise spent five years looking at the activity of 1,500 subjects. Those who were active on a daily basis were 31 percent less likely to develop high blood pressure.</p>
