<p class="content">Exercise biking are some of the most used exercise equipment both at public gyms and home gyms.  In addition, new technology and cost effectiveness has made biking and “spinning” at home as effective as at a gym.

Exercise bikes are an amazing investment for exercising at home. They are easy to use and are perfect for any fitness level.

Whether your goals are weight loss, building endurance, interval training, exercise bikes offer a wide range of daily exercises.
Remember the exercise bike? It was popular at gyms and for home use long before many of today's glitzy, high-tech exercise gadgets were invented. Maybe you even have one, stashed in the attic and serving as a rack for out-of-season clothing.

But if you're ready to get serious about getting fit, it may be time to dust off your trusty (if not rusty) steed.

When you're starting an exercise program, the key is finding something you enjoy and that's easy to do. That's what makes the stationary bike a great choice, particularly for the novice exerciser or someone with back, knee, or joint problems that make running or walking more difficult.

</br>"A stationary bike is very easy on the joints," says Kim Eskola, MS, assistant fitness director at Little Rock Athletic Club in Little Rock, Ark. For a beginner, she says, "it's also easy to use a bike," compared with, for example, a treadmill or elliptical machine.</p>
